By leveraging the extensive and authoritative health data provided by WHO, the model will be able to offer more precise predictive diagnostics and personalized medical recommendations. This integration will not only improve the reliability of the health insights generated but also ensure that the recommendations are aligned with global health standards and practices. Ultimately, this will contribute to a more robust and effective healthcare solution, benefiting users with up-to-date and globally recognized health information."
